# Traffic-data-analysis

Traffic data analysis is a very important process to solve the problem of urban traffic congestion. Through traffic data analysis, you can determine the causes of traffic jams and find ways to solve them.

### Traffic Data Collection
Traffic data can be collected in a number of ways. Typical methods include traffic cameras, vehicle recognition sensors, and GPS. By collecting this data, you can get information about where traffic jams occur, traffic volume, vehicle speed, and more.

### How to analyze traffic data
Traffic data analysis requires various analysis methods. Representative methods include cluster analysis, regression analysis, and time series analysis. These analytical methods can be used to determine the causes of traffic jams and find ways to solve them.

### Application of traffic data analysis
Traffic data analysis can be applied in various fields. For example, it can be used to widen roads to solve traffic congestion or improve public transportation. In addition, it can be applied to marketing strategies such as advertising campaigns or events by identifying traffic jam times through traffic data analysis.
